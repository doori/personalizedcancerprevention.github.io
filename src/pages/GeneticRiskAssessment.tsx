        About the MSK Genetic Risk Assessment The MSK Genetic Risk Assessment
        will help you find out if you may benefit from genetic testing for
        hereditary cancer, based on your personal and family history of cancer.
        The Genetic Risk Assessment is based on a combination of National
        Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for certain types of hereditary
        cancer testing and supplemental materials.

        To answer some questions, it will be helpful to have these ready:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Medical, pathology, or surgical report if youâ€™ve ever been diagnosed
            with: breast, colorectal, kidney, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate,
            stomach, thyroid, or uterine (endometrial) cancer
          </li>
          <li>
            Pathology or surgical report from any colonoscopy where you had
            colon polyps
          </li>
          <li>
            Medical, pathology, or surgical report if a blood relative has ever
            been diagnosed with breast, prostate, or stomach cancer
          </li>
          <li>
            Genetic test report if you or a blood relative had previous genetic
            testing If you aren't sure how to answer a question, you can always
            leave and come back later after you had time to check or talk to a
            family member. When you exit the assessment, we will save your
            answers for you automatically. You should click on the Genetic Risk
            Assessment link in the MSK Content Center to come back to your
            unfinished assessment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        When you finish the Genetic Risk Assessment, it will tell you if you may
        benefit from a genetic assessment or testing. You may be told to talk
        with an MSK Care Advisor as the next step.
